#####2. An abstract that identifies the topics you intend to investigate and the tools you plan to use.
Gentrification or community transition is a divisive issue in cities across the country. While higher income residents entering a neighborhood can lead to a revitalized economy and more amenities, many are concerned that the original residents don’t reap the benefits, because they are displaced by higher rents. Our project will focus on balancing an increase in creative, knowledge based industry in a city with minimal displacement of long term residents. We will refine and expand on a model of creativity in cities (Ammar Malik et al.) to predict the effects of housing development with subsidized housing on the makeup of a neighborhood being gentrified. 
#####3. An annotated bibliography of 3-5 papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.

 For developing cities, attracting creative individuals or those who bring about knowledge-based economies is a highly desired outcome.  An ABM of a city and its citizens is developed. The environment is a 2D grid described by land use, neighborhoods, creative space, and rent. The agents have attributes like income, education, tolerance, and creativity.  They used survey data from a developing city in Pakistan, as well as analysis of overhead map imagery in order to estimate proportions of different attributes in the environment and population.

 This paper creates a model for cities with both “static” automata, like markets,  and “mobile” automata, like people. It explores the markets over time for different neighborhood makeups. The paper mostly focused on building the model as opposed to producing a lot of results, and there are a lot of parameters, but it is a cool hybrid of cellular automata and multi-agent systems, and their results showed that introducing gentrifiers and gentrifiable properties affects property values more than either in isolation.

 This paper does not come from the complexity literature.  Its insights comes from case studies and interviews of residents of areas that has experienced community transition: Jamaica Plain in Boston and Columbia Heights in DC. 

#####4. Present 1-3 experiments from these papers that you plan to replicate and 1-3 extensions or variations of those experiments you are considering.
The Creativity paper includes source code for NetLogo, so we can start with running that model and tweaking things. 
In particular, they tested three what if scenarios (altering urban land-use regulations, investing in urban transportation and improving societal tolerance levels) while measuring metrics that determined creativity.  We would be interested in measuring other metrics, especially related to how improvements to creativity in a city can also coincide with increased gentrification.
We also imagine that we can shrink the model complexity, and see if the same overall behavior in creativity diffusion is seen.

#####5. Sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.  Explain how you will interpret the results; for example, "If the power spectrum on a log-log scale is approximately linear, we will estimate its slope.  If that slope is near 1, we will conclude that the time series generated by model resembles pink noise."

If subsidized housing is developed in the same proportion as regular development, keeping all else equal, the percentage of creatives will drop, as most creatives will be barred from this subsidized housing, therefore making less available space for them to create high density neighborhoods.

![][cartoon_original_homeowners]

Since displacement is one of the primary concerns for communities who are cautious about the effects of gentrification, it is important to look at the percentage of original homeowners that were able to live in their original neighborhood.  For different levels of subsidized housing introduced in an area, this will have different effects over time for how much displacement of original homeowners occurs.

![][cartoon_gentrification_vs_creativity]

Each point on the graph represents a different percentage of how much subsidized housing is built along side of normal housing developments.  For a different percentage, a different outcome will occur.  The edge cases of this parameter are 1) no subsidized housing is developed, which will let high-paid creatives flock to an area at the expense of displacing residents and 2) all housing is subsidized housing, in which case no residents are displaced but no high-paid creatives are allowed to move to this neighborhood.  Finding the right balance between these two extremes would illuminate what amount of subsidized housing policy is appropriate for a cities desires.

#####6. __Connect to your learning goals.  Include a paragraph for each team member that explains your learning goals for the second half of the semester and how this project will help you achieve those goals.__
Margo’s Learning Goals: I would like to use the process of converting the creativity model to Python to understand it better, and figure out how to simplify things. The paper that we are basing our model off of used NetLogo, so one of our first steps will be to move that to Python, and I think that process will be very valuable. I’d like to get better at evaluating results quantitatively (through evaluating punchline graphs and comparing different versions of the model). Our project makes sense for this because we are trying many different iterations of our model with some variables eliminated, so showing when and where they differ will be important. 

Ryan’s Learning Goals: I would like to practice on my creation and delivery of compelling punchline graphs. This project will help me, because one of our extensions will be ensuring that the punchline stays the same, despite simplifications of the model.  In addition, since we plan to explore the relationship between gentrification and movement of creativity into a city, we will need to generate novel punchlines too.  Finally, I am generally curious about the topic of technology/creativity in cities interacts with the uprooting of poorer households.  I will be satisfied with more real-world theory and understanding If I can learn about the theory in this field, and some strategies cities are thinking about to achieve desirable outcomes to balance these two.
